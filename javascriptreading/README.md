#Javascript Reading

Chapter 1

- I had no idea that numbers were represented by 0s and 1s in the way that they are. I can't believe 0001101 is somehow 13. Well, I can beleive it but it's very interesting. 

- I barely knew any of what was talked about in this chapter but I did know that null means the absence of a meaningful value. 

Chapter 2

- I knew that a lot of statements and things that you type when coding need a semicolon after them. I also somewhat knew what "let" meant in the context of coding.

- I did not know what a loop was or what "while" or "do" could be used for. Now that I do to some extent, it seems that this is a very integral part of coding.

Chapter 3

- To be honest, I dont think theres a single thing in this chapter I already knew.

- One thing that was new to me was the idea of recursing. I dont know if I fully undertand how it works yet, but it seems that it has something to do with getting not only an answer from a function but also steps on how the answer was found?
