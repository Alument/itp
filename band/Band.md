#Band Markdown

A hyperlink to the site you all made ON THE INTERNET: [Site](https://cliffstrong2.github.io/)

Problems faced, decisions made: 

I was dealing with the CSS and at first I couldn't really figure out what corresponded to what. Sometimes I would change a color or font and it either would change something I didnt expect it to change or it would change nothing at all. Eventually I figured out how everything worked with H1, or H3 being headers etc.

A self-assessment of how you contributed to the group:

All I really did was change a few colors and fonts but I think it looked nice enough in the end. I'm getting to undertand CSS a bit more which is great as I plan to use it lots in my final project. 

Short assessments of your group members and the contributions they made: 

Everybody helped in some way with the website and code, as well as creating their own description of their role in the band. Clifford put the website together so I suppose he lead the group, but nobody was slacking.
