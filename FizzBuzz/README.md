#FizzBuzz
I started by copying lines 80 to 84 from the in class code along.
I then replaced 1500 with 1 and 2700 with 100 and replaced the numbers in the first if statement with 3 and 5. 
I then added two else if statements, one saying that if i / 3 was equal to 0 the number 
would be replaced with fizz, and then the same but for 5 and Buzz.
This didnt work at first because I used the wrong type of a bracket in a certain place. I fixed it. 
It then worked. Hooray.
