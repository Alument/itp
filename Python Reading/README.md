# Python Reading

Chapter 1: I knew what a program was in its simplest form (it being a sequence of instructions that perform a computation). Something I didn't know was the difference between natural and formal languages. It makes sense how formal languages such as programs are literal and very structured, meanwhile natural languages have abiguity and dont have to have a specific structure (like spoken laguage). 

Chapter 2: I didn't previously know anything that was in this chapter, but one thing I did learn (and actually understand) is the difference between fruitful and void functions, where one yeilds a value and the only only perfroms an action. 

Chapter 5: I somewhat knew what boolean expressions were since we had covered boolean logic in class. Nested conditionals also made sense relating to the nested loops we learned about. Something new was recursion, although I think I learned something similar to this in a math class somewhere along the way. 

Chapter 10: I suppose I kind of knew what a list was, or at least the basic idea of it. But it kept getting more and more complicated so I would say just about everything here was new. Aside from lists, the idea of aliasing was also new. The idea of an object having multiple unrelated variables that refer to it is interesting to me for some reason.
