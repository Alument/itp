## Header:

- I decided to start from the very top with the header. I created a banner that goes across the top of the screen, it has my name and these things called "anchor tags". 

- I did some research, and with Ezra's help I learned that I could assign these so that when clicked, take me to whatever section of the website that I want (using href). And I made sure to make the header stay at the top of the screen at all times so that I can access the anchor tags wherever I am on the page. 

## About: 

- I added a simple image of the Logic Pro icon, with a border radius of 150 to nicely round the edges. 

- Then under the about header I added a simple paragraph about me as a music producer talking about backround and skills I have. 

## Services Section:

- For this section, I had to really mess around with the CSS for each image (or service card) and its description and I ended up with an alternating pattern of left and right with the image on the left side and the description on the right and then alternating with each new service. 

- I also added a feature where hovering over each image pops it out for a second. 

- And finally I added a shadow effect on the border of each service card where the images are placed. 


## Demo/ media player section

- When making the media players, I first set them up as basically as I could, copying each one and adding the respecitve .mp3 and title. I then turned to CSS by calling up "audio" so I could edit them all at once. 

- I again added a shadow effect around the edges as well as a border radius to soften the edges to make them more pleasing to the eye. 


## My music section

- I learned that when you go into Spotify you can actually get the code to a song or album, and when you past it into the HTML, it shows a Spotify preview window of whatever song or album you chose. 
- What I did for this section was frame the code for my album and edit the frame using CSS so its the right size.
