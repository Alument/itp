# F to C
I started by using let to establish the varibale values of F for Fahrenheit and C for Celsius. 
I then used console.log(C) to convert F to C.
It gave me an answer with a lot of decimal points so I added the toFixed command to shorten it to only having 2. 
I used console.log(C.toFixed(2))for this. 
It then gave me that 99 Fahrenhiet is equal to 37.22 Celsius.
