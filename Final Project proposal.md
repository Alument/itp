I'd like to make a portfolio website, but specifically one for me as a music producer. So not just a general or musical portfolio but specirically one for music production. Id like it to have a home page of some kind with general information, and then some buttons or tabs that take you to a page of demo mp3s of music I've made, and a page with a resume of some kind. I'd like for the website to be functional and simple, but also to not look super bland or unfinihsed looking. So by using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, it should work out.

This will not overlap with another class.

A good outcome would be, a functioning website that is at least somehwat pleasing to the eye, with organized mp3's of demo music and a page with facts and details about myself as a music producer.

A great outcome would be a website with a least 3 different pages that is easy to navigate and very pleasing to eye. Essentially the good outcome but more professional. 

The best outcome would be for the website to be so amazing and useful that I actually use it in my daily life and refer people to it. This would only be the case if i felt it was truly as professional as a real website and was so well organized that it genuinly represented my skills. I suppose im hoping for this, but this would be if everything worked out perfectly which it almost never does.

Step 1: create the website using Rachel's as the starting template and then using sources start to build it into something more functional. Also gather mp3 demos of different genres of music ive made. (by november 10th)

Step 2: Have the website fully outlined, with all pages set up so they can be accessed from a home page. (by november 17th)

Step 3: Work on the content of each page, embed mp3s, use CSS to make it look good, backrounds, etc. (by november 24th)

Step 4: Finalize everything because chances are it wont have all come together perfectly so far and I will have to trouble shoot some things and finish putting eveything together. (by the due date)
